# Morrowind Open the Door

This mod opens the door you are looking at if within the activation distance. This saves you time and your spacebar. When a locked or trapped door is encountered a message written in the first person is shown to better communicate what your character might be thinking when trying to open a locked door. The mod is highly configurable, and you can tweak if an attempt is to be made to open a locked or trapped door or not. You can also tweak what kind of doors you want to be opened automatically: teleport doors, interior doors, and horizontal bar doors.

# Usage

You can obtain the mod on its [Nexusmods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51799).
